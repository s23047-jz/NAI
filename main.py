"""
A gameplay example (right), shows the first player starting 
Connect Four by dropping one of their yellow discs into the center column of an empty game board. 
The two players then alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column, 
until the second player, with red discs, achieves a diagonal four in a row, and wins the game. 
If the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then the game is a draw.

PopOut
"PopOut" redirects here. For other uses, see Pop Out (disambiguation).

A travel version of the Milton Bradley game
PopOut starts the same as traditional gameplay, 
with an empty board and players alternating turns placing their own colored discs into the board.
During each turn, a player can either add another disc from the top,
or if one has any discs of their own color on the bottom row,
remove (or "pop out") a disc of one's own color from the bottom.
Popping a disc out from the bottom drops every disc above it down one space, 
changing their relationship with the rest of the board and changing the possibilities for a connection. 
The first player to connect four of their discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
